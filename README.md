# SimplexTableHelper

## About

This repo hosts an Angular website. 

See here [website](https://vulrandier.github.io/SimplexTableHelper/).

It is a little tool build for my studies to see if my simplex tableau would work because it is really annying to calculate 10 minutes a simplex tableau for only checking
if the equations were right.

By the way it might be that maximisation does not work right now. Only tested minimisation. But soon will check and eventually update.
