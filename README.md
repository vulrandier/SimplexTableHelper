# Simple table calculator

## About

This repo hosts an Angular website.

It is a simplex table calculator. It comes in two favors. A algorithm from a book and the algorithm from my teacher.

I build this to test if my start equations are correct.

The website is here [Simplex (vulrandier.github.io)](https://vulrandier.github.io/SimplexTableHelper/)
